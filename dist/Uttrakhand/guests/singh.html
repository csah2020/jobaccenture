        <h1>Life in Nainital</h1>
       <!--<img src="../images/singh1.jpg" alt="Jaman Singh" >-->
        <p>
        Nainital is an idyllic town in the state of Uttarakhand and is located on the Kumaon region of the outer Himalayan range. 
        The scenic beauty and natural charm of the place adds to its charm. 
        It is surrounded by mountains on all sides and offers a great view of the snow capped mountain ranges.
        </p>
        <p>Nainital is blessed with a pleasant weather round the year, though the upper reaches experience heavy snowfall during the winter months from November to February when things can get really chilly. The monsoon season from June to August is best avoided for a visit as heavy rains somewhat take away the charm and make the things too slippery for comfort. 
            The best time to visit Nainital, therefore, are the months from March to June or September and October.</p>
            <p>Jaman Singh is Nainital born physicist who did his Masters in physics from the Allahabad University. 
                He worked as professor of physics at the Allahabad University. 
                Later he joined an Indian Multinational Crude Oil and Gas Corporation, ranked 7th among the Top 250 Global Energy Companies.
                Its international subsidiary ONGC Videsh currently has projects in 17 countries. He along with other employees helped ONGC discover 6 of the 7 commercially producing Indian Basins, in the last 50 years, 
                adding over 7.1 billion tonnes of In-place Oil & Gas volume of hydrocarbons in Indian basins.</p>
        <p>ONGC's operations include conventional exploration and production, refining and progressive development of alternate energy sources like coal-bed methane and shale gas. The company's domestic operations are structured around 11 assets (predominantly oil and gas producing properties), 7 basins (exploratory properties), 2 plants (at Hazira and Uran) 
            and services (for necessary inputs and support such as drilling, geo-physical, logging and well services).</p>
